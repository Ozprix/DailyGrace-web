## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Guide

This application is configured for deployment on **Firebase App Hosting**.

### 1. Prerequisites
*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   A Firebase project with the **Blaze (Pay-as-you-go)** plan enabled. App Hosting requires this.
*   [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) installed and authenticated (`npm install -g firebase-tools` and `firebase login`).

### 2. Firebase Project Setup
*   **Enable APIs**: In your Google Cloud project (linked to your Firebase project), ensure the following APIs are enabled:
    *   App Hosting API (`apphosting.googleapis.com`)
    *   Cloud Build API (`cloudbuild.googleapis.com`)
    *   Secret Manager API (`secretmanager.googleapis.com`)
*   **Enable Firebase Services**: In the Firebase Console, enable:
    *   **Authentication** (with Email/Password and Google providers)
    *   **Firestore** (in Native mode)

### 3. Production Environment Variables (Secrets)
For security, server-side keys **must not** be deployed in your code. You will use Google's Secret Manager, which App Hosting integrates with.

*   Open the [Google Cloud Secret Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager) for your project.
*   Create secrets with the following **exact names**:
    *   `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Set its value to your Google AI API key.
    *   `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Set its value to your Stripe secret key (if you plan to use it).
*   Grant the **Cloud Build service account** access to these secrets. Find the service account email in Google Cloud IAM (it looks like `[project-number]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`) and give it the "Secret Manager Secret Accessor" role.

### 4. Deploy Your App
From your project's root directory, run the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

The Firebase CLI will build your Next.js application and deploy it to App Hosting. After it finishes, it will provide you with your live URL!
